Project Title: AI-Powered Career Guidance Assistant using GenAI

In today’s fast-evolving career landscape, students often struggle to make informed decisions about their future due to a lack of accessible, personalized, and real-time guidance. Traditional career counseling services are limited in reach, inconsistent in quality, and not always available to all students—especially in remote or underserved areas. To bridge this critical gap, we designed an AI-Powered Career Guidance Assistant using Generative AI (GenAI) technologies.

Our solution leverages OpenAI’s GPT-3.5-turbo language model to provide intelligent, real-time career advice based on user input. The system is implemented through a simple web interface, where users can ask career-related questions and receive personalized suggestions. Additionally, the platform features a resume generator that creates basic resumes from user-provided details like name and skills.

The backend is built using Python and Flask, while the frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application communicates with the OpenAI API to generate responses. CORS is enabled to handle cross-origin requests between frontend and backend.

This solution demonstrates how GenAI can democratize access to quality career guidance, enabling students to explore career paths aligned with their interests and skills. It also lays the groundwork for future enhancements like language support, audio input, and integration with educational platforms.

This project showcases the real-world application of Generative AI in the education and social sector, highlighting its potential to create scalable and impactful solutions for youth empowerment.
